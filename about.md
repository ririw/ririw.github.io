My name is Richard Weiss, and I work as Data Consultant, in Sydney, Australia.

Feel free to reach out to me at [richardweiss@richardweiss.org](mailto:richardweiss@richardweiss.org) if you'd like to chat.
Particularly if you're interested in:

 - Anything I post here
 - Building the _human_ side of data science, and integrating it into organizations
 - If you've got a burning analytical question that needs answering.
